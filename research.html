        <h3 class="projectTitle"> X-ray Reflection Modeling with Fenrir </h3>
        <p class="projectDescription">
          My most recent work has been focused on trying to better interpret the X-ray reflection spectra of
          supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN), which is produced when the
          inner-most regions of the accretion disk are irradiated by a compact corona most commonly interpreted
          as the base of a black hole jet. These X-rays carry with it information about the central object, but
          unfortunately due to astrophyical uncertainties and the complexity of the physics, it is common to
          make simplifying assumptions in our models. This results in inaccuraties in the answers
          we infer from our data. For example, it is commonly assumed that the disk has negligible geometric
          thickness, an assumption that, while helpful in simplifying calculations, seems inconsistent with
          modern accretion theory.
        </p>
        <p class="projectDescription">
          In order to incorporate more accurate physics, I have created a new reflection model from scratch
          using the C++ and Python programming languages. Named <b> Fenrir </b>, this model traces the paths
          of photons through spacetime to predict the shape of the X-ray spectral features and allows for the
          use of any axisymmetric analytic disk model. Early results from this project have been presented in
          Taylor & Reynolds (2018a,b), which used a disk profile consistent with Shakura & Sunyaev (1973), suggest
          that disk geometry is indeed a major source of systematic error that had previously been largely ignored
          in the literature. For example, the inner-most accretion disk can act to shield the outer disk from the central
          corona, and thus would dominate the observed flux (see figure).
        </p>
        <p class="projectDescription">
          <b> Fenrir </b> will be released publicly as a pre-computed XSPEC grid model suite very soon (Taylor, Reynolds, & Reynolds
          in prep) and the corresponding code will be released shortly thereafter on my <a href=""> Github account </a>. Afterward,
          I will use this new model to study a number of archetypical AGN, as well as perform a parameter space exploration to
          better quantify the systematic error inherent in using past models.
