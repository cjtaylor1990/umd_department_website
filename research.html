        <h2 class="projectTitle"> X-ray Reflection Modeling with Fenrir </h3>
        <p class="projectDescription">
          My thesis work has been focused on trying to better interpret the X-ray reflection spectra of
          supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN), which is produced when the
          inner-most regions of the accretion disk are irradiated by a hot compact corona (most commonly interpreted
          as the base of a black hole jet), the disk reprocessing this radiation as a series of
          smeared X-ray spectral features. These features carry information about the black hole, but
          unfortunately due to astrophyical uncertainties and the complexity of the physics, it is common to
          make simplifying assumptions in trying to model this phenomenon. Some of these assumptions are
          unphysical, resulting in inaccuraties in the model predictions and in any answers we try to
          we infer from data using these models. For example, it is commonly assumed that the disk has
          negligible geometric thickness (i.e. is "razor-thin"), an assumption that, while helpful in
          simplifying calculations, seems inconsistent with modern accretion theory.
        </p>

        <p class="projectDescription">
          In order to incorporate more accurate accretion physics, I have created a new reflection model from scratch
          using the C++ and Python programming languages. Named <em> Fenrir </em>, this program traces the paths
          of photons through curved curved spacetime to predict the shape of the X-ray spectral features, allowing for the
          use of any axisymmetric analytic disk model chosen. Early results from this project have been presented in
          Taylor & Reynolds (2018a,b), which used a disk profile consistent with Shakura & Sunyaev (1973), suggest
          that disk geometry is indeed a major source of systematic error in reflection modeling that had previously
          been largely ignored in the literature. For example, the inner-most accretion disk can act to shield the
          outer disk from the central corona, and thus would dominate the observed flux (see figure).
        </p>

        <p class="projectDescription">
          <em> Fenrir </em> will be released publicly as a pre-computed XSPEC grid model suite very soon (Taylor, Reynolds, & Reynolds
          in prep) and the corresponding code will be released on my <a href="https://github.com/cjtaylor1990" target="_blank"> Github account </a>
          shortly thereafter. I will then use this new model to study a number of archetypical AGN, as well as perform a parameter space exploration to
          better quantify the systematic error inherent in using past models.

        <p class="projectDescription">
          Examples of intensity maps (observed flux as a function of position) for the X-ray reflection
          spectrum, for the cases of a razor-thin disk and a realistic disk from the <em> Fenrir </em> model.
