              My name is Corbin Taylor and I am an Astronomy Doctorate Candidate at the University of Maryland (UMD). At UMD, I study supermassive black holes (SMBHs, black holes millions to billions times the mass of our sun), working to better understand how these monsterous objects grow over the history of the Universe.
            </p>

            <p>
              SMBHs can grow either via mergin with other objects like itself or by pulling matter onto themselves (a process known as "accretion"). These growth processes can result in massive quantities of energy being injected (via large-scale winds and jets) into their surroundings, thus affecting the evolution of their host galaxies and the intergalactic medium. The angular momentum (or "spin") of a black hole acts as a kind of record of the object's growth history, making accurate measurements of the spin increadibly valuable to our understanding of SMBHs, galactic evolution, and the development of structure across of the Universe.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most common method by which black hole spin has been measured is via the modelling of the X-ray reflection spectrum, a region of the spectral energy distribution (SED) that is believed to be produced in the inner-most regions of the accretion flow. This allows us to measure the strength of relativistic effects (e.g. redshift and frame dragging) just outside the event horizon, inferring the qualities of the central object.
            </p>
            <p>
              As with most models, our reflection models are inperfect, relying on simplifying assumptions or approximations. I work to make more accurate and physically-motivated X-ray spectral models, thus allowing for a more accurate understanding of these "cosmic titans."
